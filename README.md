# Playwright Orchestrator

A CLI tool for orchestrating and managing Playwright test execution.

Helps to orchestrate Playwright test execution through smart sharding using existing database.

![Timeline](https://github.com/rostmanrk/playwright-orchestrator/raw/main/assets/timeline.png)

## üéØ Overview

**Test are ordered base on test timeout**.
More options will be added in next versions

The project provides tooling to analyze and orchestrate Playwright tests using available storage plugin options. Currently available plugin options:

- file: Basic storage that uses a local file as storage.
- dynamo-db: Amazon's DynamoDB adapter.
- pg: PostgreSQL adapter.
- mysql: MySQL adapter
- mongo: MongoDB adapter

## üì¶ Installation

Make sure Playwright is installed.

```bash
npm install @playwright-orchestrator/core --save-dev

npm install @playwright-orchestrator/<storage_plugin_name> --save-dev
```

## üöÄ Usage

Run the CLI tool:

```bash
npx playwright-orchestrator <command> <storage_type> [options]
```

## üìù Example

1. Run the `init` command. Required to run once to set up storage. Make sure that executing credentials have all permissions.

```bash
npx playwright-orchestrator init pg --connection-string "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/postgres"
```

2. Run the `create` command. Required to run once per run.

```bash
npx playwright-orchestrator create pg --connection-string "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/postgres" --workers 2
> 019464f7-1488-75d1-b5c0-5e7d3dde9195
```

3. Start the desired count of shards using the `run` command. Run ID is generated in the previous step. All Playwright options are already saved in the previous step.

```bash
npx playwright-orchestrator run pg --connection-string "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/postgres" --run-id 019464f7-1488-75d1-b5c0-5e7d3dde9195
```

4. Failed tests can be started again using step 3.

5. Merge report using [Playwright's Merge-reports CLI](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-sharding#merge-reports-cli)

```bash
npx playwright merge-reports ./blob-reports --reporter html
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Commands and Options

### `init`

Seeds data storage with necessary tables and initial configuration.
No additional options.

### `create`

Creates and configures a new test run. Outputs created run ID. Supports most of [playwright's options](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-cli#reference).

### `run`

Starts a test shard for the provided test run. If used with a finished run, it will only start failed tests.

Command generate blob reports into `--output` directory. To merge it use [Playwright's Merge-reports CLI](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-sharding#merge-reports-cli)

**`webServer` property is not supported and is ignored; make sure the app run beforehand.**
