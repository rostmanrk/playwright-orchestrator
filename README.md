# Playwright Orchestrator

A CLI tool for orchestrating and managing Playwright test execution.

Helps to orchestrate Playwright test execution through smart sharding using existing database.

![Timeline](https://github.com/rostmanrk/playwright-orchestrator/raw/main/assets/timeline.png)

## üéØ Overview

The project provides tooling to analyze and orchestrate Playwright tests using available storage plugin options. Currently available plugin options:

- file: Basic storage that uses a local file as storage.
- dynamo-db: Amazon's DynamoDB adapter.
- pg: PostgreSQL adapter.
- mysql: MySQL adapter.
- mongo: MongoDB adapter.

**Tests are ordered as follows:**

1. If there are no previous test runs, use the default timeout.
2. Take the [EMA (Exponential Moving Average)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Exponential_moving_average) of the test duration. The window size can be changed in [`create`](#create) command, default value is 10.
3. If there was a failed test in the chosen window, it is more likely to fail again. Therefore, the formula is adjusted as follows:

    - Calculate the EMA of the test duration.
    - Adjust the EMA by adding a factor based on the percentage of failed tests in the window.
    - The final formula is: `EMA + EMA * (% of failed tests in window)`

    **Example:**

    - If the EMA of the test duration is 2 minutes and 4 of 10 tests in the window failed, the adjusted duration would be:
      `2 + 2 * 0.4 = 2.8 minutes`

**Serial tests duration is a sum of all included tests.**

### Test identifiers

In order to keep history of tests, they need to be identified. There are multiple possible cases:

1. Default id: `[{project}] {file} > {title of the test}`.
2. Serial test id: `[{project}] {file} > {title of the parent group}`.
3. Serial test defined at the file level: `[{project}] {file}`.
4. Custom Id: `[{project}] {custom id}`.

In case some of these attributes changed, test history would be recreated. To preserve test history between changes, you can add a **static** attribute. Adding an id to an existing test would recreate the history as well.

**‚úÖ Examples**

```
import { id } from '@playwright-orchestrator/core/annotations';
test('test', { annotation: id('#custom_id') }, () => {
    // test code
}
```

```
import { id } from '@playwright-orchestrator/core/annotations';
test.describe('serial tests', { annotation: id('#custom_id') }, () => {
    // test code
}
```

**‚ùå This won't work**

```
import { id } from '@playwright-orchestrator/core/annotations';
test.describe('test', () => {
    test.info().annotations.push(id('#custom_id'));
    // test code
}
```

## üì¶ Installation

Make sure Playwright is installed by following [Playwright's installation guide](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#installation).

```bash
npm install @playwright-orchestrator/core --save-dev

npm install @playwright-orchestrator/<storage_plugin_name> --save-dev
```

## üöÄ Usage

Run the CLI tool:

```bash
npx playwright-orchestrator <command> <storage_type> [options]
```

## üìù Example

[Mongo](/.github/workflows/mongo.yml)

[DynamoDB](/.github/workflows/dynamo-db.yml)

1. Run the `init` command. Required to run once to set up storage. Make sure that executing credentials have all permissions.

```bash
npx playwright-orchestrator init pg --connection-string "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/postgres"
```

2. Run the `create` command. Required to run once per run.

```bash
npx playwright-orchestrator create pg --connection-string "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/postgres" --workers 2
> 019464f7-1488-75d1-b5c0-5e7d3dde9195
```

3. Start the desired count of shards using the `run` command. Run ID is generated in the previous step. All Playwright options are already saved in the previous step.

```bash
npx playwright-orchestrator run pg --connection-string "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/postgres" --run-id 019464f7-1488-75d1-b5c0-5e7d3dde9195
```

4. Failed tests can be started again using step 3.

5. Merge report using [Playwright's Merge-reports CLI](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-sharding#merge-reports-cli)

```bash
npx playwright merge-reports ./blob-reports --reporter html
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Commands and Options

### `init`

Seeds data storage with necessary tables and initial configuration.
No additional options.

### `create`

Creates and configures a new test run. Outputs created run ID. Supports most of [playwright's options](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-cli#reference).

### `run`

Starts a test shard for the provided test run. If used with a finished run, it will only start failed tests.

Command generate blob reports into `--output` directory. To merge it use [Playwright's Merge-reports CLI](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-sharding#merge-reports-cli)

**`webServer` property is not supported and is ignored; make sure the app run beforehand.**
