# Playwright Orchestrator

A CLI tool for orchestrating and managing Playwright test execution.

## üéØ Overview

The project provides tooling to analyze and orchestrate Playwright tests using available storage plugins options. Currently available plugins options:

- file . Basic storage that use local file as storage.
- dynamo-db . Amazons DynamoDB wrapper.
- pg . PostgreSQL wrapper.

## üì¶ Installation

Make sure playwright is installed.

```bash
npm install @playwright-orchestrator/core --save-dev

npm install @playwright-orchestrator/<storage_plugin_name> --save-dev
```

## üöÄ Usage

Run the CLI tool:

```bash
playwright-orchestrator <command> <storage_type> [options]
```

## üìù Example

1. Run `init` command. Required to run once to setup storage. Make sure that execution credentials has all permissions.

```bash
playwright-orchestrator init pg --connection-string "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/postgres"
```

2. Run `create` command. Required to run once per run.

```bash
playwright-orchestrator init pg --connection-string "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/postgres" --workers 2
> 019464f7-1488-75d1-b5c0-5e7d3dde9195
```

3. Start desirable count of shard using `run` command. Run id generate in previous step. All playwright options already saved in previous step.

```bash
playwright-orchestrator init pg --connection-string "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/postgres" --run-id 019464f7-1488-75d1-b5c0-5e7d3dde9195
```

4. Failed test can be started again using step 3.
